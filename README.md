<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Parking spots nowadays are fundamental. The increase of vehicles and parkingsmakes it difficult for drivers to find vacant parking spaces rapidly. For a Parking company, itâ€™s hard to supervise all of its parking manually, wasting time, energy, and patience.
In the 21st Century, time is gold. So wasting time is a meager problem to identify the spots of its parking in Real-Time.

Here's the solution:
* Each parking supervisor had a Desktop Application that allows him to track the vehicles in the parking in Real Time.
* Using the technology of Light Sensors (LDR) to track the presence each vehicle.
* Vehicle informations are stored in a Database. 

A good reflection is to answer the questions of type *WWWHW*.
***What*** :
Application for the supervisor to supervise in Real-Time the Occupied/Vacant places
and the state of the barriers.

***Who*** :
Parking supervisors of the parking.

***When*** :
All the time.

***Why*** :
Make the supervising of the parking easy and fast.
Autonomous Parking.

***How*** :
The supervisor authenticates himself to be connected to the interface where he can see the Occupied/Vacant places and if there is a problem within the barriers.
The vehicle will be detected then Arduino will check if there is an empty place then open the barrier or maintain it close.
